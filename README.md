# Or run in detached mode
docker-compose up -d --build
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

## üöÄ Recent Improvements

### Performance & UX Enhancements
- **Smoother Interactions**: Removed all disruptive popup warnings and alerts
- **Better Drag-and-Drop**: Fixed reordering issues with sorted tables
- **Enhanced Mobile**: Improved touch detection and haptic feedback
- **Real-time Sync**: Fixed WebSocket room naming for reliable updates
- **Visual Consistency**: Tile coloring works for bench players in matchups
- **Point History**: Now displays selected defenders above matchups

### Technical Improvements
- **WebSocket Stability**: Consistent room naming (`game:${gameId}`)
- **Drag-and-Drop Logic**: Handles visual order vs data order correctly
- **State Management**: Better handling of selected defenders
- **Database Efficiency**: Optimized queries for point creation
- **Error Handling**: Silent validation for better UX

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker ps

# Verify DATABASE_URL
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Reset database
cd backend
npx prisma migrate reset
```

### WebSocket Connection Issues
- Ensure backend is running on correct port
- Check CORS settings in backend
- Verify VITE_WS_URL in frontend .env
- Check browser console for connection errors

### Build Issues
```bash
# Clear all caches and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Clear Docker cache
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

### Common Errors
- **"Cannot find module"**: Run `npm install` in the affected directory
- **"Prisma client not generated"**: Run `npx prisma generate` in backend
- **"Port already in use"**: Kill the process using the port or change PORT in .env
- **"Invalid token"**: Clear localStorage and login again
