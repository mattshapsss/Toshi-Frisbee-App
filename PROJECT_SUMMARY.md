## Technologies Used

### Backend
- Node.js 20 + Express + TypeScript
- PostgreSQL 15 (database)
- Redis 7 (cache/sessions)
- Prisma ORM (database toolkit)
- Socket.io (WebSockets)
- JWT (authentication)
- Bcrypt (password hashing)
- Zod (validation)

### Frontend
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite (build tool)
- TailwindCSS (styling)
- Socket.io Client (real-time)
- Zustand (state management)
- React Query (data fetching)
- React Router (routing)
- Axios (HTTP client)

### Infrastructure
